# CREATE 2

## An 8-bit inspired Choose Your Own Adventure game for your browser

Before I left Xaxis I was tasked with the principal development of our second quarterly newsletter, Create, but it quickly morphed into a single developer project. A sort of farewell gift from the team to me. With full artistic and development license behind me I drew graphical inspiration from Nintendo Capcom titles and employed modern ECMA6 development paradigms to build out a Xaxis themed newsletter that made otherwise dry content engaging and dynamic.
